"""Gridded (spatially varying) rainfall -> RainfallScenario on the model grid.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
SIH26085 asks for "high-resolution rainfall nowcasts (from Doppler Weather Radars)" routed "across a 2D
surface terrain model". Until this module, `RainfallScenario` could only carry a `[T]` scalar series, so
rainfall was spatially uniform **by construction, for every provider** -- obtaining radar data would not by
itself have satisfied the requirement, because the engine had nowhere to put a field. That structural gap was
recorded as decision D-15. This module closes the engine-side half of it: any source that can produce a
gridded rainfall field can now be resampled onto the model grid and handed to the engine as a genuine
`[T, ny, nx]` field.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES *NOT* DO
------------------------------
It does not make rainfall real. It is transport and regridding only. The provenance of whatever field is
passed in is preserved verbatim and is the caller's responsibility:

  - a real radar/QPE product -> tag it REAL (and name the product, resolution, timestamp)
  - an NWP field             -> tag it NWP
  - an invented test field   -> tag it SYNTHETIC

`synthetic_moving_storm()` at the bottom is SYNTHETIC and is labelled as such in its provenance. It exists so
the spatial pathway can be exercised and tested end-to-end without waiting on a data licence, and it must
never be presented as observed rainfall of any kind, radar or otherwise.

RESAMPLING CONTRACT
-------------------
The engine deliberately refuses a field whose grid does not match the terrain grid, so regridding happens
here, once, explicitly. `resample_to_model_grid()` transforms each model cell CENTRE to the source CRS and
samples the source field there (bilinear, with edge clamping), which is the correct direction for
"which source pixel does this model cell fall in" and avoids the common error of resampling the model grid
onto the coarser source.

A source coarser than the model grid (e.g. a 0.1 deg satellite product ~ 11 km over a 2.4 km pilot) will
resample to a field that is nearly or exactly uniform. That is not a bug and it must not be hidden: it means
the source carries no sub-pilot spatial information. `describe_effective_resolution()` reports exactly that,
and `scenario_from_gridded()` records it in the scenario's provenance note, so a uniform-looking "spatial"
field can never be passed off as resolving the storm.
