"""Rainfall provider abstraction: separates rainfall SOURCE from the simulation.

The simulation engine (`floodnet.simulation.engine`) consumes a `RainfallScenario` (see `contracts.py`) as its
only rainfall interface and is untouched by this module. A `RainfallProvider` is simply a different way of
producing a `RainfallScenario`, plus a `RainfallSourceMeta` describing where that scenario's numbers came
from, so callers (the API layer) can ask "give me rainfall input X" without knowing whether X is a hardcoded
design storm, a replayed historical event, or (in the future) a live nowcast feed.

Six providers are wired today:
  - `ScenarioProvider`          SYNTHETIC design storms: moderate / heavy / cloudburst.
  - `HistoricalReplayProvider`  REAL, transcribed historical event: 26 July 2005 (Chitale Committee report).
  - `IMDObservationProvider`    REAL observed rainfall from the IMD API Management Platform
                                 (api.imd.gov.in), when `IMD_API_KEY` is configured -- see
                                 `docs/LIVE_RAINFALL_AUDIT.md` for the full access audit. Raises
                                 `ProviderUnavailable` (not a fabricated value) when no key is configured or
                                 the call fails.
  - `ECMWFForecastProvider`     NWP forecast (0-3h precipitation) from ECMWF via Open-Meteo
                                 (api.open-meteo.com/v1/ecmwf) -- see `docs/ECMWF_OPENMETEO_AUDIT.md`.
                                 (Introduced while IMD API access was pending; IMD access has worked since
                                 2026-09-18 and ECMWF remains the forward-looking NWP source.) This is a
                                 numerical-weather-prediction FORECAST, not a radar nowcast and not an IMD
                                 product; never labelled as either. Raises `ProviderUnavailable` (not a
                                 fabricated value) if the call fails or returns insufficient data.
  - `IMDRadarNowcastProvider`   DISABLED-BY-DEFAULT integration boundary for IMD Doppler Weather Radar. It is
                                 the honest place a radar feed would attach, and it is deliberately inert:
                                 `.get()` always raises `ProviderUnavailable` with an "ACCESS PENDING -- ..."
                                 reason. No radar image is fetched, no pixel is decoded, no rainfall value is
                                 invented or borrowed from another source. See decision D-14
                                 (`docs/DECISIONS.md`) and `docs/LIVE_RAINFALL_AUDIT.md` §8b/§8c.
  - `ExternalNowcastProvider`   DEPRECATED, retained only for import compatibility -- superseded by
                                 `IMDRadarNowcastProvider`. Calling `.get()` raises `NotImplementedError`.

No rainfall data is invented or duplicated here: `ScenarioProvider` and `HistoricalReplayProvider` both
delegate to the existing `floodnet.data.scenarios.scenarios()` dict (see that module's docstring for the
full provenance of each series) rather than re-declaring the numbers.

`RainfallSourceMeta` is a NEW dataclass local to this module (not `contracts.py`) -- it augments, but never
replaces, a scenario's own `.provenance` field.

    drive a "LIVE" run -- see `docs/LIVE_RAINFALL_AUDIT.md` for the full source audit this class implements.

    WHAT THIS ACTUALLY GETS, and why it cannot be a true radar/NWP nowcast
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The audit found no IMD API product that returns a quantitative rainfall INTENSITY time series at the
    engine's native 5-min resolution. The best real, quantitative, station-specific value documented is the
    `current_wx` endpoint's "Last 24 hrs Rainfall" (mm) -- a single cumulative total for the last 24 hours at
    one station, current as of its last observation time. `district_nowcast`/`station_nowcast` exist but are
    CATEGORICAL warning bands (e.g. "Cat12: Heavy rain: > 15 mm/hr"), not a numeric mm/h value -- using them
    to synthesise a quantitative hyetograph would be exactly the kind of silent fabrication this project
    forbids, so this class does not use them.

    NORMALISATION (the only transformation applied, and it is a real one, not hidden):
    the observed 24h total is divided by 24 to get a mean mm/h rate, then held CONSTANT (a "persistence"
    assumption -- the simplest, most conservative real nowcasting baseline, not a radar extrapolation) across
    every 5-min step of the 3h forecast window. This is why the resulting `RainfallScenario` is tagged
    `Tag.ESTIMATED`, not `Tag.REAL`: the OBSERVATION is real, the 3h SHAPE is a stated, simple assumption
    layered on top of it -- exactly the same "REAL input + stated derivation rule = ESTIMATED" pattern
    already used elsewhere in this codebase (e.g. Manning's n, node inverts).

    AUTHENTICATION (resolved -- two DIFFERENT credentials, not one value sent twice)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The IMD API Management Platform evaluates auth BEFORE routing (proven with a nonsense-path control that
    returned a byte-identical 401), and it requires BOTH headers on every request:
        X-API-Key:     <subscription key>     -> IMD_API_KEY
        Authorization: Bearer <JWT>            -> IMD_API_TOKEN   (a different value; NOT the API key)
    An earlier version of this class sent the single `IMD_API_KEY` value as both headers and additionally as
    an `apikey` query parameter, because the transmission mechanism was then unverified. That is now settled:
    the `apikey` query parameter is NOT accepted (a request carrying it and nothing else returns
    `{"error":"API key missing"}`), so it has been removed -- it could never authenticate and only risked
    leaking the key into URLs, logs and proxies. See docs/LIVE_RAINFALL_AUDIT.md.

class ECMWFForecastProvider(RainfallProvider):
    """REAL rainfall FORECAST source: ECMWF numerical weather prediction, fetched from Open-Meteo's
    free ECMWF endpoint (api.open-meteo.com/v1/ecmwf). Introduced while IMD API access was pending; IMD
    access has worked since 2026-09-18 and this remains the forward-looking NWP source. See `docs/ECMWF_OPENMETEO_AUDIT.md` for the full source
    audit this class implements: endpoint, exact fields, temporal resolution, and limitations.

    WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
    ---------------------------------
    Open-Meteo's `precipitation` hourly variable is ECMWF IFS model output: "Total precipitation (rain,
    showers, snow) sum of the preceding hour" (mm) -- an NWP FORECAST, not an observation and not a radar
    nowcast. It carries no relationship to IMD; it is never labelled IMD, radar, or nowcast anywhere in this
    codebase. Tagged `Tag.NWP` (see provenance.py), a tag that already existed in this codebase specifically
    for this purpose (see `ExternalNowcastProvider`'s docstring) and was, until now, unused.

    NORMALISATION (the only transformation applied, and it is a real one, not hidden): the engine needs
    `intensity_mm_h` at RAIN_DT_S (5-min) resolution; Open-Meteo returns hourly values. Since Open-Meteo's own
    hourly figure already represents the whole hour ("sum of the preceding hour"), each real hourly value is
    held CONSTANT across that hour's 5-min steps -- the exact same convention already used by
    `floodnet.data.scenarios.scenarios()['july2005']` for the (also hourly) Chitale/Santacruz replay ("mm in
    1 h == mm/h; hourly values held constant across each hour's 5-min steps"). No value is interpolated,
    invented, or estimated between real hourly points.

    The FloodNet 0-3h engine window needs 3 consecutive future hourly values; if Open-Meteo returns fewer
    (edge-of-forecast-window, malformed response, a null in the needed hours, etc.) this raises
    `ProviderUnavailable` rather than zero-filling the missing hour(s) -- an unfilled hour would silently read
    as "no rain", which is exactly the kind of fabrication this project forbids.

class IMDRadarNowcastProvider(RainfallProvider):
    """Integration boundary for IMD Doppler Weather Radar (DWR Mumbai) -- WIRED, DOCUMENTED, AND DISABLED
    BY DEFAULT. It never produces a rainfall value; `.get()` always raises `ProviderUnavailable`.

    This class exists so that (a) radar has one honest, named place to attach if access is ever granted, and
    (b) `/api/status` can say "ACCESS PENDING" out loud instead of radar being silently absent. It fetches
    nothing: no HTTP client is imported, no image is downloaded, no pixel is decoded, no capture job exists.

    WHY IT IS DISABLED (decision D-14, docs/DECISIONS.md; evidence docs/LIVE_RAINFALL_AUDIT.md §8b/§8c)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Two independent investigations (a specialist audit and an adversarial re-check, both against official IMD
    sources) concluded that radar is BLOCKED for defensible quantitative use:

    1. NO DOCUMENTED ENDPOINT. IMD's API reference indexes 28 APIs, but the document body ends at §20.
       "Radar Image" (`#api-25`) is a dead anchor: no URL, no parameters, no response schema is published
       anywhere. There is nothing to implement against.
    2. EXISTENCE CANNOT EVEN BE PROBED. The platform evaluates auth BEFORE routing (proven with a
       nonsense-path control returning a byte-identical 401), so without a credential one cannot tell a real
       endpoint from a typo. Auth needs two headers (X-API-Key and Authorization: Bearer <JWT>).
    3. THE PUBLIC IMAGERY IS NOT A QUANTITATIVE INPUT. `mausam.imd.gov.in/Radar/sri_mum.gif` genuinely is
       Surface Rainfall Intensity in mm/hr with its Z-R relation printed in-band (Z = 152 * R^1.5) -- but its
       top colour bin is OPEN-ENDED at ">100 mm/h", below FloodNet's own `cloudburst` (120 mm/h) and
       `july2005` (190.3 mm/h) intensities, so precisely the events this project exists to model would be
       clipped to an unknown value. Add ~+-3.33 mm/h bin quantisation, ~12.5% of the pilot footprint hidden
       under the drawn coastline, 30-40 min latency, and a rain rate inferred at 2 km altitude. Decoding a
       rendered picture is a lossy reconstruction of a visualisation, not an observation, and must never
       carry an observation-class provenance tag.
    4. NO ARCHIVE, SO NO HINDCAST. Directory listings return 403 and there are ~3 Wayback captures in six
       years; a historical radar-driven validation run is impossible from free sources.
    5. LICENCE UNRESOLVED. `copyRightPolicy.php`/`termscondition.php` 404 while `disclaimer.php` asserts IMD
       copyright with no grant; the official supply route (`radarapi.imd.gov.in`, Radar Division) requires an
       account, a written data request and payment. No harvesting has been started, deliberately.
    6. ~~THE ENGINE COULD NOT INGEST IT ANYWAY (decision D-15).~~ **NO LONGER TRUE as of 2026-09-14.**
       `RainfallScenario` now carries an optional `intensity_field_mm_h` `[T, ny, nx]` + `field_grid`,
       `runoff_fn` accepts a per-cell field, and `engine.run_simulation` routes it through the 2D surface
       model; `floodnet.rainfall.gridded` handles reprojection/resampling onto the model grid. A gridded
       radar field now has somewhere to go. **The remaining blockers are 1-5 above -- all of them data
       access and licensing, none of them architecture.** See D-15 (resolved) and D-16 in docs/DECISIONS.md.

    WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ENABLE IT (all of these, not any of them)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    a. A written, published (or licensed) radar data endpoint from IMD with a real response schema -- product
       type, units, grid definition, timestamps -- not a rendered image.
    b. Credentials for it: `IMD_API_KEY` (X-API-Key) AND `IMD_API_TOKEN` (Bearer JWT).
    c. A resolved licence permitting programmatic retrieval and retention for this use.
    d. ~~A `RainfallScenario` that can carry a gridded field (D-15)~~ -- **DONE.** Build the scenario with
       `floodnet.rainfall.gridded.scenario_from_gridded(...)`, which resamples the radar grid onto the model
       grid and records the effective resolution honestly (it will state plainly if the source cannot resolve
       structure inside the pilot). `IMERGSatelliteProvider` is a worked example of this exact shape.
    e. Then, and only then: set `IMD_RADAR_ENABLED=1` and implement `_fetch()` in place of the raise below,
       tagging output `Tag.REAL` for a true QPE product or `Tag.ESTIMATED` for anything derived.

    FAILURE BEHAVIOUR: raises `ProviderUnavailable` -- the same contract the live/ECMWF providers use, which
    callers must treat as "tell the user this source is unavailable". It never falls through to another
    provider and never returns a substituted or synthesised series under a radar label.

class IMERGSatelliteProvider(RainfallProvider):
    """REAL, CC0-licensed, GRIDDED satellite precipitation for Mumbai: NASA/JAXA GPM **IMERG Early Run V07**.

    This is the first provider in FloodNet that produces a genuine `[T, ny, nx]` spatial rainfall field
    (via `floodnet.rainfall.gridded`) rather than one number per timestep. It exists because SR-01 asks for
    gridded, high-resolution rainfall, and because the engine can finally accept a field (decision D-15 was
    the blocker; the contract now supports it).

    ============================================================================================
    WHAT THIS IS -- AND, PRECISELY, WHAT IT IS NOT
    ============================================================================================
    **It is NOT ground radar, and it is NOT a radar nowcast. Do not label it as either, anywhere.**

    IMERG's half-hourly 0.1 deg grid is built from a constellation of **passive-microwave** sensors plus
    **geostationary infrared**, morphed in time. A spaceborne radar (the GPM Core Observatory's Dual-frequency
    Precipitation Radar) enters only *indirectly*: the PMW estimates are intercalibrated to the GPM Combined
    Radar-Radiometer Analysis (CORRA) product, which is where DPR contributes. The pixels you download are
    not radar measurements of Mumbai.

    The only honest one-line description, and the one used in this class's provenance note, is:
    *"satellite passive-microwave/infrared precipitation, intercalibrated against a spaceborne-radar
    (GPM DPR/CORRA) reference"*. Anything shorter that contains the word "radar" unqualified is misleading.

    ============================================================================================
    THE RESOLUTION LIMITATION -- STATED UP FRONT, NOT BURIED
    ============================================================================================
    IMERG's cell is 0.1 deg. At the pilot's latitude (~19.02 N) that is about **11.1 km north-south and
    ~10.5 km east-west, i.e. ~117 km2**. The Hindmata/Dadar pilot box (72.835-72.855 E, 19.010-19.030 N) is
    about **2.4 x 2.55 km ~ 6 km2** and falls **entirely inside the single IMERG cell spanning
    72.8-72.9 E / 19.0-19.1 N** -- it does not even straddle a cell boundary.

    **Therefore this provider supplies real, correctly-scaled, time-varying rainfall with a verifiable
    licence and provenance, but ZERO spatial variation across the pilot.** Going from the uniform scalar
    providers to IMERG is an upgrade in *provenance and temporal realism*, not in spatial detail. The field
    this provider returns is genuinely a field -- and it is genuinely (near-)constant in space at pilot
    scale. `gridded.scenario_from_gridded()` detects this automatically and writes it into the scenario's
    provenance note; that note must not be edited out downstream.

    A second consequence, equally important: at 30-minute, ~11 km resolution IMERG cannot represent the
    120 mm/h and 190 mm/h convective cores this model is built around -- those are sub-grid and sub-half-hour.
    The synthetic design storms remain the right tool for stress-testing; IMERG is the observed/baseline mode.

    Licence      **CC0** -- NASA's data-use policy: data from a NASA-led mission are licensed CC0 unless
                 marked otherwise. This is the only rainfall source wired here with a verified open licence.
    Latency      ~4 h for the Early Run (Late ~12-14 h, Final ~3 months).
    Credential   A free **Earthdata Login** is required. This provider reads a bearer token from
                 `EARTHDATA_TOKEN`. With no token it raises `ProviderUnavailable` -- it never substitutes,
                 estimates, or falls back to another source.
    Format       HDF5, so parsing needs `h5py`, which is an OPTIONAL dependency (`pip install -e .[imerg]`).

    the real API (the IMD provider has since been verified live; this one has not). The first

    the failure mode if it is wrong.
