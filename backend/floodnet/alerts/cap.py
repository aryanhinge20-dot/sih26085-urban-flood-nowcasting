"""OASIS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.2 draft generation from a FloodNet `SimulationResult`.

Specification followed: "Common Alerting Protocol Version 1.2", OASIS Standard, 1 July 2010
(http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html). Element names, required/optional
cardinality, element ORDER (the schema uses <sequence>), the enumerated values and the coordinate and
date-time formats below were all read from that document -- none of them are invented here.

Relevant literal constraints from the specification that this module implements:

                           "[latitude],[longitude]" order; "A minimum of 4 coordinate pairs MUST be
                           present and the first and last pairs of coordinates MUST be the same."
  * <circle>               "a central point given as a [WGS 84] coordinate pair followed by a space
                           character and a radius value in kilometers."

HONESTY CONTRACT (see the package docstring)
--------------------------------------------
Every message produced here is `status = Draft`, which CAP 1.2 itself defines as "A preliminary template
or draft, not actionable in its current form". FloodNet is not a designated alerting authority, does not
transmit anything, and has no SACHET/cell-broadcast/SMS path. `scope = Restricted` with an explicit
`<restriction>` says the draft is for the reviewing authority, not for public dissemination by FloodNet.

Every number in the generated message is read out of the `SimulationResult` handed in. There are no
example/placeholder values anywhere in this file.

WHY A DRAFT IS THE ONLY HONEST OUTPUT (researched 2026-09-10, sources in the module's report)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
India's national CAP platform is NDMA SACHET (https://sachet.ndma.gov.in/About), conceptualised and
funded by NDMA and "Developed and maintained by C-DOT", which states it "Complies to ITU-T x.1303 Common
Alerting Protocol (CAP) Standard". Its published workflow has two distinct roles: **Alert Generating
Agencies** (NDMA/C-DOT training material names IMD, CWC, INCOIS, DGRE and FSI) draft warnings, and an
**Alert Authorizing Agency** -- the concerned SDMA, or MHA -- authorises them before dissemination
through authorised telecom service providers. Platform access is OTP / trusted-device gated.

NDMA publishes exactly one integration document, "CAP XML Feed Integration Guide for Agencies", and it is
about CONSUMING the feed ("This guide describes how external agencies should consume the CAP XML feed
efficiently"). No public interface for a third party to SUBMIT an alert was found anywhere on
sachet.ndma.gov.in, ndma.gov.in, cdot.in or dot.gov.in. This module therefore does not attempt one, and
contains no SACHET endpoint, credential or client.

The draft-then-authorise split is the recognised international pattern, not a workaround:
  * OASIS CAP 1.2 provides the `Draft` status value for precisely this.
  * WMO's own wis2box CAP tooling splits "CAP composer" (may only submit for moderation) from
    "CAP approver" (approves and publishes).
  * US IPAWS names third-party "CAP Alert Origination Tools" built by "Alert Origination Service
    Providers"; the alerting authority holds the credentials, the tool does not.
  * Sahana SAMBRO (ITU-T X.1303 deployments in Myanmar/Philippines) carries the approving officer in a
    custom `sahana:approver` CAP <parameter> because CAP has no approver element. FloodNet mirrors that
    with `FloodNet:approvalStatus`.

No published India-specific CAP profile (an analogue of the US IPAWS profile or Canada's CAP-CP) could be
found, so this module claims CAP 1.2 conformance only, and does NOT claim conformance to any Indian
profile. Where SACHET's live feed shows a de-facto convention, we follow it: `language = en-IN`, polygon
based targeting, and no <geocode> (no Indian geocode valueName scheme was observed in live SACHET or IMD
CAP messages, so inventing one would be a fabrication).
