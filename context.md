# FloodNet — verified repository state

**SIH26085 — Urban Flood Nowcasting System ("Drainage and Rainfall Coupling")**
Pilot: Mumbai — Hindmata / Dadar (MCGM F/North & F/South)

**Written:** 2026-09-10, from the actual final code and test state — not from task descriptions.
Every number below was measured in this session or is cited to the file that produces it.

**Status labels used here:** `IMPLEMENTED` (code exists and runs) · `VERIFIED` (measured/executed this
session, evidence quoted) · `PARTIAL` (works with a stated real gap) · `BLOCKED` (external dependency)
· `PLANNED` (not built; recorded so it is never reported as done).

> **Blanket caveat, stated once and applying to every UI claim in this document:** browser automation in
> this environment **cannot reach this machine's localhost** — confirmed by a control test that
> successfully loaded an external site and then failed on `localhost:5174`. **No click-through, no visual
> rendering, and no console-error check has been performed on any UI change described here.** Everything
> UI-side is code-reviewed and build/lint-verified only. A human must eyeball the dashboard before the demo.

## 1. What FloodNet does

```
rainfall → runoff → 2D surface routing → drainage graph → hydraulic capacity
        → surcharge → street-level depth → 0–180 min forecast → GIS dashboard → flood-safe routing
```

One coupled loop, `backend/floodnet/simulation/engine.py::run_simulation`. 37 frames at 5-minute output
over a 180-minute horizon (`config.py`: `HORIZON_S = 3*3600`, `FRAME_DT_S = 300`), internal adaptive
sub-stepping at ≤5 s. Grid 244×255 @ 10 m (2.44 × 2.55 km). Network: 1,233 nodes / 1,134 edges / 116 outfalls.

---

## 2. Drainage forecast architecture — `VERIFIED`

**The 0–3 h drainage forecast is real, not a static display.** Directly measured this session on a
cloudburst run: individual conduits and manholes evolve independently frame to frame.

```
edge 17444  util:  t=0 0.000 → t=30 0.451 → t=60 1.000 → t=120 0.509 → t=180 0.033
node 2172031407 HGL: 23.77 → 23.77 → 27.56 → 23.77 → 23.77 m   (fills 3.8 m, drains back)
surcharging_count across 37 frames: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,90,134,175,200,218,207,199,…,45
```

Rain peaks at T+45; surcharging peaks at T+60 — a physically correct ~15-minute lag, reproduced from
real MCGM network geometry.

### Per-frame drainage outputs (`contracts.Frame`) — `VERIFIED` complete

| Field | Shape | Window |
|---|---|---|
| `node_hgl` | `[1233] f32` | instantaneous at frame boundary |
| `node_surcharging` | `[1233] bool` | instantaneous (last 5 s sub-step) |
| `node_surcharge_m3` | `[1233] f32` | **accumulated over the 300 s interval**, reset each frame |
| `node_cause` | `[1233] str` | `""` / `overcapacity` / `blockage` / `downstream` |
| `edge_flow_m3s`, `edge_util` | `[1134] f32` | instantaneous |

An audit confirmed **every** one of these reaches the API — there is no "computed but hidden" drainage
data at frame level.

### Lead-time signal — `IMPLEMENTED` + `VERIFIED` (the main win of this sprint)

Previously `/series` exposed only `surcharging_count` and `surcharge_m3`, so an operator saw "all clear"
while the network was already saturating. Measured, before and after the fix:

```
t=30.0  rain=72.8  surcharging=0   ←  operator saw "nothing wrong"
        …but edges at ≥1.0 capacity = 10,  edges ≥0.8 = 15,  max_edge_util = 1.000
```

`GET /api/simulation/{run_id}/series` now additionally returns, per frame:
`cause_counts{overcapacity,downstream,blockage}`, `edges_at_capacity`, `edges_near_capacity`,
`mean_edge_util`, `max_edge_util`, `nodes_at_capacity`. **Thirty minutes of lead time that existed in the
frame data but was invisible is now a first-class signal.**

`edges_near_capacity` (util ≥ 0.8) is **descriptive only** — it is *not* a validated distress threshold
the way the node `fill ≥ 0.999` boundary is, and is labelled that way in the code.

---

## 3. Drainage state definitions — `IMPLEMENTED` + `VERIFIED`

Three tiers, served per node from `serialize_frame` as `state`:

| State | Definition | Provenance of the threshold |
|---|---|---|
| `surcharging` | spilled to street during the frame interval | the solver's own criterion, `excess = V − vfull > 1e-9` |
| `at_capacity` | `fill_frac ≥ 0.999`, no spill this interval | **the solver's own constant** — `hydraulics.py` uses `V >= vfull*0.999` internally to decide a node is full and blocking upstream flow |
| `normal` | everything else | — |

Plus per node: `fill_frac` (0–1), `freeboard_m` (metres below street level). Per edge:
`edge_capacity_m3s`, `blockage`.

**An invented "near capacity ≈ 0.85" band was explicitly rejected**, and this is deliberate. Node depths in
this network range 0.57 m – 4.47 m, so a fixed fill-fraction means 0.086 m of freeboard on one node and
0.67 m on another — the same colour for operationally different states. No source supports such a band.
Instead `fill_frac` is encoded **continuously** (radius/opacity, hue held constant) so the eye sees a
gradient without the UI asserting a boundary the physics does not have.

Measured distribution at cloudburst peak — the tiers discriminate rather than washing the map:
`normal: 996 · surcharging: 231 · at_capacity: 6` (of 1,233).

### Surcharge undercount — `BUG FIXED`, `VERIFIED`

`node_surcharging` samples only the final 5 s sub-step while `node_surcharge_m3` accumulates all 300 s, so
nodes that surcharged earlier in an interval reported as normal. Independently measured by two audits.
Now the serialized boolean is `raw_flag OR surcharge_m3 > 0`. Measured effect:

```
t=40  instant= 90 → interval=102  (+12)
t=45  instant=134 → interval=153  (+19)
t=60  instant=218 → interval=231  (+13)
t=65  instant=207 → interval=232  (+25)   ← ~11% undercount
11 frames affected
```

`/series`'s `surcharging_count` uses the same corrected definition, so **map and timeline now agree
exactly** (verified 153/153, 231/231, 174/174). The raw value is preserved as `surcharging_count_instant`
so older `docs/VALIDATION.md` figures stay traceable.

---

## 4. Drainage → street coupling: what is and isn't established — `VERIFIED`

This is the most important scientific finding in the repository and it bounds what may be claimed.

**Mass conservation is exact.** Instrumented over a full run: `45,751.31 m³` surcharged vs
`45,751.306 m³` re-injected to the surface; per-cell residual `6.9e-18`; engine mass-balance error `-0.0`.

**Surcharge can never make a street wetter.** Verified across **42,339 surcharging node-steps**: surcharge
never exceeds what the inlet took from that same cell in the same step (max ratio exactly
`1.000000000`). This is structural — pipe inflow to a non-outfall node is clamped at its remaining free
storage, so all excess originates from that node's own inlet capture. **The drainage network is a strict
net sink at every cell; surcharge is a ~97.6% refund of water just swallowed there. No water from
elsewhere in the pipe network is ever delivered onto a street.** In this model drainage can only *fail to
drain* — it cannot flood.

**Per-location causal attribution is NOT established:**
- `r = 0.048` between segment peak depth and nearest-node surcharge (2,978 segments × 36 frames)
- 91.6% of wet street-frames have a non-surcharging nearest node; 97% under moderate rain
- the four deepest segments in the pilot all have **0.0 m³** surcharge at their nearest node
- nearest-node association is pure Euclidean proximity (median 41 m, max 452 m), not a computed flow path
- 388 segments deepened under blockage (one by **+43.6 cm**) while their nearest node never surcharged

**System-level causality IS established.** 70% capacity cut → outfall discharge −19.4%, surface storage
+9.8%, 1,127 segments deeper vs 14 shallower.

**Therefore the honest claim is:** *"drainage capacity is a demonstrated driver of flooding in this ward,
and here is the counterfactual"* — **not** *"this street is flooded because that node is surcharging."*
UI language was corrected accordingly (§7).

---

## 5. Blockage what-if — `IMPLEMENTED` + `VERIFIED`

Structurally incapable of misrepresentation: `BlockageSpec` accepts only `none/fraction/edges/random/near`
— there is no field anywhere that could carry an observed measurement, and the base MCGM network is always
built with `edge_blockage = zeros`.

Measured three-point dose-response (heavy, 180 min, identical rainfall forcing):

| Blockage | Edges affected | Total surcharge | Peak surcharging nodes | Max depth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| none | 0 / 1134 | 45,751 m³ | 186 | 268.702 cm |
| random 30% @ 60% | 340 / 1134 | 70,987 m³ | 256 | 268.702 cm |
| uniform 70% | 1134 / 1134 | 124,981 m³ | 424 | 268.723 cm |

Strictly monotonic — physically well-behaved. **Note max depth moves 0.021 cm across the entire range**
while surcharge volume nearly triples, because the deepest cell is a terrain depression that saturates
regardless. Surcharge volume was therefore added as a headline metric; peak depth alone was the wrong
number to lead with.

`provenance.blockage` is now present on **every** run, top-level, including baselines, which previously
emitted nothing at all:

```json
{"tag":"SYNTHETIC","source":"baseline (no blockage applied)",
 "note":"Drainage assumed clear (0% blockage). FloodNet has no live drain-condition telemetry;
         this is always an operator-set scenario assumption, never an observation."}
```

Hierarchy: blockage was demoted below "Run forecast" into a collapsed `<details>` — "What-if: reduced
drainage capacity (optional)" — so the rainfall→forecast path reads as the primary product.

> **Open conflict for the owner to settle:** `docs/SIH_REQUIREMENTS.md` designates the blocked-vs-unblocked
> A/B as *"the headline demo"* for SR-08, which contradicts the "blockage clearly secondary" instruction
> this sprint worked to. The code now follows the instruction, not the doc. One of them should change.

---

## 6. Timestep behaviour — `VERIFIED`

One authoritative `currentT` in `FloodNetContext.jsx`. All 10 `setInterval`/`setTimeout`/`Date.now()` call
sites were audited: **no wall-clock value reaches time selection anywhere.** The playback timer advances by
*index into `run.frames_t_min`*, never by elapsed time. Scrubbing serves from a client-side frame cache and
**never re-runs physics** (uncached frames cost one cheap serialization GET).

Current-frame vs forecast-peak is distinguished explicitly on four independent surfaces
(MetricsPanel, WhyFloodedPanel, AlertsPanel, ForecastTimeline).

### Bugs found and fixed this sprint

| Bug | Status |
|---|---|
| **`isStale` key-order bug** — backend echoes blockage keys sorted, frontend compared with raw `JSON.stringify`, so **every** non-`none` blockage run was born stale: header said "Inputs changed — Run forecast" while map/timeline/streets/alerts/why-flooded/routing all rendered it in full. This broke the SR-08 headline demo on every static scenario. | `FIXED` `VERIFIED` — canonicalised over the full `BlockageSpec` field set; tested against the exact empirically-captured mismatches plus negative controls |
| `runCompare` substituted a 50% blockage without updating state, self-invalidating every compare from the default | `FIXED` |
| `route`/`alternatives` survived a re-run, so a prior run's routes displayed against a new `run_id` (worst for ECMWF/live re-pulls) | `FIXED` |
| Route alternatives did not re-evaluate on scrub, **and** `MapView` gave the candidate layer priority over the auto-refreshing single route — so stale geometry was drawn over current flood colouring with no disclosure | `FIXED` (disclosure, not auto-recompute) |

Route alternatives now expose `alternativesStale`; stale candidates render dashed/de-emphasised on the map
and the panel shows both timesteps with an inline alert. The per-candidate "safe through T+X" line is
correctly **exempt** — it scans the full horizon and is timestep-independent.

---

## 7. Scientific-honesty corrections — `IMPLEMENTED`

| Location | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `WhyFloodedPanel` cause text | "the nearby drainage node is surcharging because an outgoing pipe is blocked" | "…it can no longer drain the water it captures. This is a local hydraulic signal near this location, **not a computed flow path to this specific street**." |
| `WhyFloodedPanel` surcharge chain | "backwater surcharges up through street inlets" | "has lost capacity to drain — captured inflow is being held rather than carried away" |
| `WhyFloodedPanel` runoff | "converts **85%+** rainfall into runoff" (hardcoded; model's real ratio is **80.9%**) | qualitative, no false precision |
| `WhyFloodedPanel` terrain | "toward **Hindmata depression bowl**" on every segment ward-wide | "toward lower-lying terrain" |
| `LandingPage` DRAINAGE stage | "water surcharges up through street gully inlets" | "inlets can no longer carry away the water they capture, and it accumulates at street level" |
| `ScenarioPanel` compare note | "normal (brass) vs blocked (terracotta)" | "(blue) vs (orange)" — matches the actual `#2563eb`/`#ea580c` strokes |

Earlier in the same session, eight fabricated claims were removed from `LandingPage.jsx`, including a
"never synthetic" assertion, a false MCGM-calibration badge, an unsourced "944 mm" figure (the scenario
actually replays 380.8 mm/3 h per the Chitale Committee), and a coordinate/elevation pair that fell
**outside** the simulated pilot bounding box.

## 8. Rainfall providers — `PARTIAL` (SR-01 is the standing gap)

| Provider | Class | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic design storms | SYNTHETIC | `IMPLEMENTED` |
| July 2005 replay | REAL / HISTORICAL (Chitale, single non-local gauge) | `IMPLEMENTED` |
| ECMWF via Open-Meteo | **NWP forecast** — never a nowcast, never an IMD product | `IMPLEMENTED` `VERIFIED` (live call succeeded, 138 s) |
| IMD observation | REAL observation → **ESTIMATED persistence**, gated on `IMD_API_KEY` | `BLOCKED` (no credential) |
| Radar nowcast | — | `BLOCKED` — see below |

### Radar: decision **PATH D** — `BLOCKED`, recorded as `D-14`

Investigated by a specialist agent and then independently adversarially reviewed; the review **overturned
the specialist's central claim**, which is why this is a refusal rather than a feature.

- IMD's API reference indexes 28 APIs but its body ends at §20 — **"Radar Image" is a dead anchor**, no
  endpoint/params/format documented. Auth is evaluated *before* routing (proven with a nonsense-path
  control), so endpoint existence cannot even be probed without a credential.
- The public `sri_mum.gif` genuinely **is** Surface Rainfall Intensity in mm/hr with the Z-R relation
  printed in-band — correcting this repo's earlier claim that it was reflectivity-only.
- **But it is unusable here:** its top bin is open-ended at `>100 mm/h`, while this project's own
  `cloudburst` (120 mm/h) and `july2005` (190.3 mm/h) scenarios exceed it — it censors exactly the regime
  FloodNet models. Plus ±3.33 mm/h quantisation, ~12.5% of the pilot footprint occluded by the drawn
  coastline (Dadar sits on it — systematic, not averageable), 30–40 min latency, rain rate inferred at
  2 km altitude, and the image is resampled (0.4277 km/px, not the stated 0.4).
- The "96.6% of pixels decode exactly" evidence was reproduced at 96.40% **and decomposed: 96.27 points
  are the No-Data background; actual rain-bin pixels were 0.13%.** The statistic measured empty sky.
- No free historical archive (listings 403, ~3 Wayback captures in six years) → no hindcast possible.
- Licence is **unresolved and worse than recorded**: `disclaimer.php` asserts IMD copyright with **no
  grant**; the official route (`radarapi.imd.gov.in`) needs an account, a request and **payment**.

**No radar decoder is being built. No image-capture job has been started** — harvesting copyrighted
imagery on an unresolved licence was declined deliberately, despite an "every hour is lost" argument. The
zero-cost unblocking step is a written enquiry to the Radar Division (`radarlab@gmail.com`) — a human action.

### The structural finding that reframes SR-01 — `PLANNED`, recorded as `D-15`

`contracts.RainfallScenario.intensity_mm_h` is `[T]` and `intensity_at()` returns a single `float`, which
`engine.run_simulation` passes to `runoff_fn`. **Rainfall is spatially uniform by construction for every
provider. FloodNet cannot ingest a gridded rainfall field from any source today.** Acquiring radar data
would not, by itself, satisfy the "high-resolution/gridded" half of SR-01. Generalising `RainfallScenario`
to an optional `[T, ny, nx]` field is the honest prerequisite — **not implemented, not scheduled.**

---

## 9. Routing and location search — `IMPLEMENTED` + `VERIFIED`

- `POST /api/route` — unchanged contract (verified: **0 lines changed inside the handler**; the new work is
  appended after it).
- `POST /api/route/alternatives` — 2–3 genuinely diverse candidates (Yen's + Jaccard de-duplication) scored
  under **SAFEST / FASTEST / BALANCED**, plus per-candidate "safe through T+X".
- **"Fastest" is labelled "Fastest (by distance)" throughout** because the graph carries only `length_m` —
  there is no speed or travel-time model. This is honest, not a shortcut.
- Objectives correctly diverge only under flooding: at T+0 all three pick the same route (no flood → zero
  penalty → safest ≡ fastest); at T+180 they split (`safest:0, fastest:1, balanced:0`). Good demo moment.
- **No traffic provider exists** and none was faked; the UI states "Traffic data: not connected".
- **Location search** — 179 real named roads (grouped across segments, resolved to the midpoint of each
  name's longest segment) + 4 verified landmarks, all from actual pilot OSM data via `lib/locations.js`.
  No third-party geocoder was added — it would resolve queries worldwide and imply coverage where no
  simulation data exists. Search and map-click are fully interchangeable (both route through `pickPoint`).

---

## 10. Performance — `IMPLEMENTED` + `VERIFIED` bit-identical

Re-profiled from scratch (cProfile, real pilot, heavy/70%/180 min): `terrain/surface.py::_substep` was
**67.6%** of self-time, `drainage/hydraulics.py::step` **21.2%** — independently confirming the prior
~68%/20% estimate, with call counts matching exactly.

Optimisation applied: 16 pre-allocated scratch buffers + `out=` kwargs, plus hoisting an invariant boundary
check. **Allocation strategy only — operand order and float operation sequence unchanged.**

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `_substep` self-time | 44.531 s | **34.989 s** |
| profiled total | 66.791 s | **52.062 s** |

**Validation gate passed in full:** frame-by-frame `np.array_equal` = **True** on all 37 frames' depth
grids, surcharging arrays and HGL arrays — max abs diff `0.0`, max rel diff `0.0`. Mass balance identical
to full precision (`-3.770585409371645e-12`), peak depth identical (`268.7231779098511 cm`), peak
surcharging nodes identical (`424`). This is bit-for-bit equality, not "within tolerance".

**Deliberately NOT optimised:** the `hydraulics.py` hot path. It is the exact site where a prior 3.3×
speedup was reverted after frame-by-frame validation caught real discrepancies. It stays as-is.

Full-run wall clock remains **~90–150 s** (large environmental variance — a warm run measured *slower* than
a cold one on an unchanged binary). Not real-time; **no claim of real-time computation is made anywhere.**

---

## 11. Tests, build, production paths

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `pytest backend/tests` | **136 passed, 4 skipped** (was 126/4 at session start; +10 routing tests) |
| The 4 skips | Intentional live-service opt-outs, verified via `pytest -rs` — gated on `IMD_API_KEY` / `RUN_LIVE_ECMWF_TEST` |
| `npm run build` | Clean, **62 modules** |
| `npm run lint` | **0 errors**, 7 warnings — all pre-existing, none introduced across 21 modified files |
| `/static/`, `/static/dashboard` | **200** (SPA fallback) — runtime-verified against a live server |
| `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/api/health` | **200** |
| Missing static asset | **404** (correctly not swallowed) |

**Operational warning for demo day:** a stale backend process was found serving old code without
`/api/route/alternatives` registered. **Restart the backend before demoing** —
`backend/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn floodnet.api.main:app --port 8000`. Also do not run the test
suite while the demo backend is serving: the same suite took 97 s idle vs 279 s under contention.

---

## 12. SIH compliance (independently re-verified against code, not docs)

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| 0–3 h horizon | `COMPLETE` |
| High-resolution DEM | `COMPLETE` w/ caveat — real MCGM 20 cm contours → 10 m grid; 0.65% of cells flagged (not altered) as inconsistent with surveyed manholes |
| Runoff / imperviousness | `PARTIAL` — real rational method, but imperviousness is an uncalibrated OSM-geometry rule with a flat 0.6 default |
| 2D surface routing | `COMPLETE` w/ documented limitation — diffusive-wave storage-cell, no lateral momentum |
| Graph drainage network | `COMPLETE` — real MCGM geometry/connectivity/inverts |
| Hydraulic capacity | `PARTIAL` — real geometry, but a single assumed Manning n = 0.013 network-wide |
| Blockage / overcapacity | `COMPLETE` as a scenario tool; never presented as observed |
| Surcharge | `COMPLETE` · **Tidal/tailwater backflow: `MISSING`** — outfalls are unrestricted free sinks; grep-confirmed absent, and this is Hindmata's actual real-world failure mode |
| Street depth in cm | `COMPLETE` — metres internally, ×100 at the API boundary, 8 call sites checked, no unit bugs |
| GIS dashboard | `COMPLETE` — no mock/random data anywhere in the operational dashboard (grep-verified; the only `Math.random` is decorative hero-animation particle jitter) |
| Flood-safe routing API | `COMPLETE` |
| Provenance | `COMPLETE` — genuinely data-driven, traced to real construction sites for rainfall, DEM and drainage |
| **Rainfall nowcast (SR-01)** | **`PARTIAL` / `BLOCKED`** — no radar nowcast exists; and per §8 the gridded-input gap is in **our own engine interface**, not only in data access |
| Real-time operation | `PARTIAL` — ~90–150 s per full run, honestly reported |

---

## 13. Known limitations (stated, not hidden)

1. **No tidal/tailwater boundary** — the dominant real Mumbai mechanism. All 116 outfalls accept unlimited
   flow; 19 are bbox-clip artefacts. The model therefore **under**-predicts drainage-caused flooding by an
   unquantified amount, and attributes ~97% of surcharge causes to `downstream` partly because of it.
2. **Surcharge cannot flood a street** (§4) — drainage can only fail to drain. Any future UI copy must
   respect this.
3. **Per-location causal attribution is not supported** (§4) — only ward-level counterfactuals are.
4. **Inlet capacity (0.05 m³/s) and manhole storage (1.5 m²) are blanket assumptions**, not measurements —
   and the inlet cap is precisely the constant at which the surcharge signal saturates, so surcharge
   *magnitude* is an artefact of an uncalibrated number.
5. **`drainage/attributes.py` is dead code in production.** It holds a better-cited parameter table
   (arch conduits at n = 0.015) and `refine_attributes()` is never called — the live path uses a blanket
   0.013 for all 1,134 conduits including 62 British-era brick arch drains. Correcting this is a ~13%
   capacity change on those conduits, so it is a physics change requiring the full validation gate. `PLANNED`.
6. **HGL is capped at ground level**, so there is no surcharge *severity* — two spilling manholes cannot be
   ranked.
7. **Rainfall is spatially uniform** for every provider (§8).
8. **No calibration against observed flood depths** — none exist publicly. Mass conservation validates
   numerical accounting, **not predictive accuracy**.
9. **Latent leak:** 10 off-grid non-outfall nodes would silently discard surcharge. Currently 0.0 m³, so
   mass balance still closes, but a different bbox would lose water with no error surfaced.
10. **Frame prefetch pulls ~49 MB per run**, 74.5% of it the `streets` payload re-sent identically each frame.
11. **No browser QA has been performed** (see the caveat at the top).

## 16. The judge questions, answered from implemented evidence

| Question | Implementation | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| **WHERE** will it flood? | Per-segment depth, max grid depth in a 6 m buffer around 2,978 real OSM segments | 10 m grid; a single deep cell (possibly a DTM pit) sets the segment value |
| **WHEN?** | 37 real frames, 5-min spacing; measured 15-min rain→surcharge lag | Only as trustworthy as the driving rainfall — NWP or replay, never a radar nowcast |
| **HOW DEEP?** | cm at the API boundary, metres internally, unit-checked | DEM vertical SD 0.283 m vs surveyed manholes — cm display exceeds terrain accuracy |
| **WHY?** | `/explain`: nearest node, real `edge_util`, `node_cause`, ground elevation | Cause is a 3-way threshold heuristic; **nearest-node is proximity, not a flow path** |
| **WHAT is happening in drainage?** | 3 tiers per node per frame + full aggregate series with lead-time signals | No surcharge severity (HGL capped); no tidal backflow |
| **CAN a vehicle pass?** | `passable()` vs `VEHICLE_LIMIT_CM` (car/motorcycle 30, ambulance 40, truck/pedestrian 60) | `config.py` labels these "WORKING THRESHOLDS, NOT CITED GUIDANCE" |
| **WHICH route is safer?** | 3 objective-scored candidates + safe-through-T+X, on the real flood-weighted OSM graph | "Fastest" is distance-only; no traffic data |
| **WHERE did the data come from?** | Per-field `Provenance(tag, source, note)` populated at point of use, surfaced in the API and UI | The notes honestly carry the limitations above |
